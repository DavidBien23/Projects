# Projects

A collection of coding projects that I have created.


### Bayes-Buhl_Straub_Estimation & Bayesian Empirical Estimation:

<p>During my college course dedicated to the Short Term Actuarial Mathematics (STAM), 
we learned about predicting the next claim from multiple given distribution of previous 
claims. We learned two methods for this as described by the file titles which included/excluded 
respectively the exposure of each claim. I create a file which would request user input 
on the number of claims in each category, amount per claim, and weight of exosure if necessary.</p>

### Dave's Life Contigent Actuarial Calculator (DLCAC):

<p>In contrast to the previous project where I worked on the short term, this project 
focused on the concepts of Long Term Actuarial Mathematics (LTAM). Ironically, the STAM 
project took only a week while the LTAM took about a month and is still in progess as of 
the Fall of 2023 as I take the second portion of the class. My goal was to make the calculator 
user friendly so I used the pythons built-in tkinter module for the first time. I also created 
an executable file for the calculator with the same goal in mind.</p>
