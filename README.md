### Bayes-Buhl_Straub_Estimation & Bayesian Empirical Estimation:

<p>During my college course dedicated to the Short Term Actuarial Mathematics(STAM), 
we learned about predicting the next claim from multiple given distribution of previous 
claims. We learned two methods for this as described by the file titles which included/excluded 
respectively the exposure of each claim. I create a file which would request user input 
on the number of claims in each category, amount per claim, and weight of exosure if necessary.</p>
